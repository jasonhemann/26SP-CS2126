> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about
> data structures and their relationships.
>
> ― Linus Torvalds

> Generally, the craft of programming is the factoring of a set of
> requirements into a set of functions and data structures.
>
> ― Douglas Crockford

> Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and
> organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be
> self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to
> programming.
